    <h3 align="center">Password Generator</h3>
    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this project is to add javascript to a pre-existing password generator page so that users will be able to generate a password based on the their selected requirements. I built this project because as we advance into a more tech-based society, users are more prone to be victims of hacking and scams. With a random password generator, the chances of being hacked is much lower than if we were to passwords we come up with. This password generator is a solution for users who are looking for a secure password or are looking to generate a password to meet certain requirements. Through this project, I learned how to store user input and use and interact with that data to do something meaningful. I also learned a lot of new methods that comes with javascript and gotten practice with different data types and loops.

## About the Project

This project is a password generator. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this password generator, there are 2 main components: password length and character requirements. A user will be prompted to enter in the length of their password and also choose what sorts of characters to include in their password. After confirming, the user will be shown a password that meets those requirement.

## Installation

Nothing is needed to install this project. It is deployed on pages through Gitlab and can be accessed online. If this is being used as a template or source code for refactoring, one can download the code or clone the source code to their own repository.

## Usage

This project, a password generator is built to help users generate a secure password based on selected requirements. When the website is loaded, user can press the "Generate Password" button which will prompt the user to enter a number between 8 and 128 to indicate the length of the password. If a user were to either 1) have a response containing of alphabets, 2) not enter whole numbers, or 3) enter numbers out of range, they will be asked to re-enter a length (show in visual #1). Next, an alert will show up that acts as instruction for how to select required characters (shown in visual #2). Then, users will be asked to confirm whether they would like certain characters: numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special letters. After each decision, a confirmation will be provided for the user. If the user fails to choose at least one character, they will be asked to confirm elements again. Otherwise, the generator will print out the randomized password based on the criteria on the webpage.
