    <h3 align="center">Password Generator</h3>
    <p align="center">
        The motivation for this project is to add javascript to a pre-existing password generator page so that users will be able to generate a password based on their selected requirements. I built this project because as we advance into a more tech-based society, users are more prone to be victims of hacking and scams. With a random password generator, the chances of being hacked are much lower than if we were to passwords we come up with. This password generator is a solution for users who are looking for a secure password or are looking to generate a password to meet certain requirements. Through this project, I learned how to store user input and use and interact with that data to do something meaningful. I also learned a lot of new methods that come with javascript and got practice with different data types and loops.

## About the Project

This project is a password generator. This project is built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In this password generator, there are 2 main components: password length and character requirements. A user will be prompted to enter the length of their password and also choose what sorts of characters to include in their password. After confirming, the user will be shown a password that meets that requirement.

## Installation

Nothing is needed to install this project. It is deployed on pages through Gitlab and can be accessed online. If this is being used as a template or source code for refactoring, one can download the code or clone the source code to their own repository.

## Usage

In this project, a password generator is built to help users generate a secure password based on selected requirements. When the website is loaded, the user can press the "Generate Password" button which will prompt the user to enter a number between 8 and 128 to indicate the length of the password. If a user were to either 1) have a response containing alphabets, 2) not enter whole numbers, or 3) enter numbers out of range, they will be asked to re-enter a length (shown in visual #1, #2, #3). Next, an alert will show up that acts as an instruction for how to select required characters (shown in visual #4). Then, users will be asked to confirm whether they would like certain characters: numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special letters. After each decision, a confirmation will be provided for the user. If the user fails to choose at least one character, they will be asked to confirm elements again (shown in visual #5). Otherwise, the generator will print out the randomized password based on the criteria on the webpage (shown in visual #6).
